The Good:

Olivia’s doctors decided to perform the laparotomy to search for possible areas of infection.  The surgeons found that her intestines look healthy!  This is EXCELLENT news!  She still could have strictures down the road or possibly have a NEC infection, but we are very pleased.  No ileostomy, no removal of bowel.  YAY!!!  Our surgeon anticipates they may do the PDA surgery early next week after Olivia has healed from today’s procedure.

The Bad:

There is no clear reason for Olivia’s continued thrombocytopenia (low platelets).  The hematologist team is now the team of focus.  They are exploring a variety of conditions and may do a bone marrow/biopsy on Wednesday.

The Ugly:

Olivia will now have a scar across her belly.  We will just match is all.  I’ve never been a bikini wearer myself so we can find matching tankinis or one piece suits.
