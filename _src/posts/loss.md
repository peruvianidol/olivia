Olivia passed away this afternoon.  Her PDA ligation was a difficult procedure and Olivia did not tolerate it well.  The poor little bean just could not handle it!  We are infinitely grateful for all of the prayers, well wishes, love, gifts, cards, EVERYTHING we have received from our friends and family.  Most of all, we are grateful for the love that was shared between Olivia and us.  Even at the end, she knew that her Mommy and Daddy were there for her.  She kept her heart rate up to make sure we were there and even opened her eyes.  Please honor her existence by asking about her, our experiences and how much we adored her.

In lieu of flowers, please consider making a gift in honor of Olivia to the following organizations which assisted our family during this time of crisis:

* [Jackson Chance Foundation](http://www.jacksonchance.org/donate/)

* [Lurie Childrenâ€™s Hospital](https://www.luriechildrens.org/en-us/care-services/family-services/programs/Pages/donations.aspx)
