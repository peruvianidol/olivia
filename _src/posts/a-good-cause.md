In the midst of all the chaos, Mike and I have decided to actively support programs that support the families of and children with significant medical needs.  Enter Extra Life, the video game marathon that supports some of the best children’s hospitals in the country.  Mike being a video game aficionado, it’s the perfect marathon.

Beginning at 8AM tomorrow, Mike will play video games for 24 hours straight in an effort to raise $1,000 for Lurie Children’s Hospital.  He will be broadcasting his video game playing live at [twitch.tv/peruvianidol](https://twitch.tv/peruvianidol). I will be playing with him for a laughable hour (I am terrible at video games) as will Joe.  If you can, support this wonderful cause.  Lurie’s goes out of its way to take care of children with the highest quality healthcare.  We are blessed beyond measure that Olivia has benefited from this great hospital!
