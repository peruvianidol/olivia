Insert cliche–no news is good news!  Olivia’s daily plan, for the most part, has been to continue gestating.  They have attempted to wean a few settings on the ventilator; however, little miss likes the settings to remain very specific.  They continue to return to status quo.  The good news is her repeat echo Monday showed she went from a very large PDA to a large PDA, which for the moment signifies shrinkage.  The medical team feels that surgery is too invasive of a measure and would like to observe further shrinkage of the PDA.  I’m all for that!

In the meantime, Olivia has pooped again from her bottom and the hole where the drain was continues to heal well.  For the first time since birth, Olivia went a week without a blood transfusion which points to her bone marrow beginning its important work.  No major episodes of A’s and B’s (apnea and bradycardia).  As she is now officially one month old, they have stopped the humidity setting on her isolette.  I continue to kangaroo her as often as possible and am enjoying the calmer days in the NICU.

While we are not where we want to be, we are on the right road.  Olivia is officially 29 weeks gestation today.  It is absolutely amazing to look back and see how far we have come!  Let the time fly by while we are holed up in the NICU; but please let it slow down once we make it home so that we may savor every moment.
