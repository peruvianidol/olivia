This Tuesday, December 16, 2014 a memorial mass will be said in Olivia’s honor.  The service will be held at Old St. Patrick’s Church (700 W Adams St, Chicago IL).

Parking is at the Southeast Corner of Adams and DesPlaines and is free for guests; however, guests need to tell attendant they are present for the memorial mass and since it is a commuter lot (and Tuesday is a weekday) some of your guests may need to leave their keys with the attendant on duty. There are multiple lots in the area, but those will require payment.
