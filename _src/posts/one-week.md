Yesterday marked one week since our little Olivia roared into the world.  We are infinitely grateful for every moment we have been able to spend with her.  In this short amount of time, she has grown remarkably.  Sorry for the poor quality blue picture below, but she still requires the bilirubin light.  Thus far, her vitals are stable and her prognosis is great.  They have found she has a rather significant PDA (opening of the heart valve) which may require further treatment down the line and she is still struggling with a possible infection in her GI tract. Tomorrow they will begin incorporating small amounts of breast milk into her fluids.  We have had more positive days than rollercoaster days thus far.  We continue our days with the faith that Olivia will come home with us in December!
