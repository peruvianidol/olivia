At the start of Olivia’s illness, she had ballooned to 1 pound 9 ounces.  Most of this was fluid retention and her doctors continued her dosage weight at 1 pound 4 ounces.  A few days ago, her doctors let us know that she is probably closer to her real weight now and her dosage weight was changed to 1 pound 6 ounces.  Yesterday, she weighed in at 680 grams which is roughly 1 pound 8 ounces!  Her girth continues to hover between 20 and 21 centimeters.  As it has not gone up, this is good.  Her belly is slightly beginning to appear better and both the attending physician and her primary nurse heard evidence of bowel gasses yesterday.  While there are no guarantees, this is very heartening!

Olivia continues to gestate in her special humidified isolette.  She has been peacefully sleeping the day away, growing and healing as we would all like her to do.  The surgeons have begun retracting the drain and requested we not begin kangaroo care until the drain is completely removed a few days from now.  As we were pleasantly surprised kangaroo care was even suggested, we will continue to wait patiently.

The next week or two will simply be a wait and see period.  Every premature infant comes with multiple challenges that must be dealt with in a manner which best suits the child.  For now, Olivia’s job is to rest, grow and heal so she is strong enough for any surgery necessitated by any one of these hurdles.  All continue their vigilant watch of her condition, but the watch has been more peaceful with less visits from the doctor.
