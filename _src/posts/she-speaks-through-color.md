title: She Speaks Through Color

It is so hard to be the mommy of a daughter who resides in the after-life. But she speaks with a paint stroke and bold color.  Belly full of hope, I planted flowers with anticipation we would one day do it side by side. Dirty little fingers, patient tone of voice, a garden planted in love. She led us to our home, her home, where she got right to work painting purples and pinks and yellows and oranges (although purple is her favorite, always has been and thus, dominates the landscape).  She says “hello, mommy” painting rainbows across the sky, bringing her mommy to tears.  Quite the artist, full of love, she reminds us that with every winter life springs anew.  We will love her for eternity, growing each day in intensity and permanence.  Little lamb, I wish I could hug you and tell you how much I adore your artwork.
